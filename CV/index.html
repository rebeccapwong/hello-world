<p align="justify"> For a more interesting look at my CV, including pictures and reports, check out the projects tab. If you really are an avid reader 
  or just prefer text-based items, then you can find my normal CV as a pdf by clicking <a href="/CV/rebeccawong_cv_public.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">And if the PDF document does not open, I apologize; I have failed you, and you should let me know.</p>
